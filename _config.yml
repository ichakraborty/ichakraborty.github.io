  Welcome to my website! I’m Isha Chakraborty. I am working on my Ph.D from [Rice University](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) 
  where I work with [Ashutosh Sabharwal](https://ashu.rice.edu/) and 
  [Guha Balakrishnan](https://www.guhabalakrishnan.com/). 
  I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning and digital health. 
  I recently won the National Institute of Health + National Library of Medicine's Gulf Coast Consortia's Predoctoral fellowship to fully fund my MS/PhD with Biomedical Informatics & Data Science training, 
  collaborating with the Baylor College of Medicine, Neurology and Neurosurgery.

  Before Rice, I attended the [California Institute of Technology (Caltech)](https://www.caltech.edu/) for my undergrad, studying computer science and information & data science, 
  where I was advised by [Prof. Adam Blank](https://www.countablethoughts.com/) and worked with [Prof. Lior Pachter](https://pachterlab.github.io/) 
  to generate polygenic risk scores from RNA-seq data for early diagnosis of diseases.
  I’ve also worked in industry as an intern at Amazon, in the Alexa Devices org where I worked on publishing Alexa device resource updates from multiple devices.
