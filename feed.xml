I’m Isha Chakraborty. I am working on my Ph.D from [Rice University](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) 
where I work with [Ashutosh Sabharwal](https://ashu.rice.edu/) and 
[Guha Balakrishnan](https://www.guhabalakrishnan.com/). 
I&apos;m interested in the intersection of machine learning and digital health. 
I recently won the National Institute of Health + National Library of Medicine&apos;s Gulf Coast Consortia&apos;s Predoctoral fellowship to fully fund my PhD with Biomedical Informatics &amp; Data Science training, 
collaborating with the Baylor College of Medicine, Neurology and Neurosurgery.

Before Rice, I attended the California Institute of Technology for my undergrad, studying computer science and information &amp; data science, 
where I was advised by [Prof. Adam Blank](https://www.countablethoughts.com/) and worked with [Prof. Lior Pachter](https://pachterlab.github.io/) 
to generate polygenic risk scores from RNA-seq data for early diagnosis of diseases.
I’ve also worked in industry as an intern at Amazon, in the Alexa Devices org where I worked on publishing Alexa device resource updates from multiple devices.
